**A repository for custom file templates that I have found incredibly useful either at work or for my personal projects. I'll add more to this repositoy as I create them **

**1) MVP using Mosby **

At the place where I work, Mosby happened to be popular choice for MVP but I found myself repeatedly creating 6 files for any new activity or fragment that I wanted to build out using MVP. I decided to create a custom file template that creates 6 base files necessary for Mosby MVP given a feature name. Not only does this help me but it ends up saving some time for my teammtes as well. For those looking to get started with custom file templates, this blog is an excellent starting point and helped me get upto speed pretty quickly: https://riggaroo.co.za/custom-file-template-group-android-studiointellij/

**Important Note: I am not advocating Msoby is the perfect solution for using MVP in Android. This template is something that helped me and my teammates and may not be an ideal solution for everyone **
